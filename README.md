global superclustering


Run the bash script: make_globalphy.sh in order to install a virtual environment for running global superclustering.
In the folder globalphy type: 
     python setup.py install 
in order to cythonize

Finally test the algorithm by generating synthetic data by running the following three Python scripts in succession:

test_generate_supercat.py
emlaunch_synthetic_test_get_initclust.py
emlaunch_synthetic_test_with_init_4.py
